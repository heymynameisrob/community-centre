We are a small Community Centre in the heart of Wetmore, Burton on Trent. 

The Community Centre was originally a Methodist Chapel built in 1837 and was used as a place of worship for many denominations over the years before being sold to ESBC. Upon obtaining the Chapel the Borough Council donated the hall to the parish of Burton on Trent for use as a Community Hall for the people of Wetmore. It has been rather neglected over the past 5 years and following the pandemic, never really opened again.  

In 2022 it was awarded a grant by ESBC to repair the damaged floor and enable the hall to open again. It is currently undergoing further grant applications for further improvements but is most certainly up and running and a perfect place for a group activity or childrenâ€™s party. We have a fully stocked toy cupboard and plenty of tables and chairs. It has a brand new, beautiful floor and we have so many plans for further improving our beautiful hall. The acoustics in the Hall are amazing and it is crying out for a choir to open their voices to the community.

The Community Centre committee are particularly interested in attracting groups to meet in the evenings.
